  \hspace{2.5ex}Dear George,
  
  Greetings to all at Oxford.  Many thanks for \textcolor{crimson}{your}
  
  letter and for the Summer examination \textcolor{crimson}{package}.
  
  All Entry Forms and Fees Forms should be \textcolor{crimson}{ready}
  
  for final despatch to the syndicate by \textcolor{crimson}{Friday}
  
  20th or at the very latest, I'm told, by the \textcolor{crimson}{21st}.
  
  Admin has improved here, though there's \textcolor{crimson}{room}
  
  for improvement still; just give us all two or \textcolor{crimson}{three}
  
  more years and we'll really show you! \textcolor{crimson}{Please}
  
  don't let these wretched 16+ proposals \textcolor{crimson}{destroy}
  
  your basic O and A pattern.  Certainly \textcolor{crimson}{this}
  
  sort of change, if implemented \textcolor{crimson}{immediately},
  
  would bring chaos.

  I thought it was unlikely that the text was actually encrypted 
  (a strategy that did not work that well on problem 2).
  On this problem, I tried to look at the words in different positions in the text 
  --- every first word in a sentence, every last word, every $n$th word, in sentence $n$, etc.

  Using this strategy, I deciphered this message (highlighted in red above):

  Your package ready Friday 21st, room three. Please destroy this immediately.
