  ABSTRACT = {The intelligentization of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) has recently attracted intensive interest. Visual perception of the water scenes is critical for the autonomous navigation of USVs. In this paper, an adaptive semantic segmentation method is proposed to recognize the water scenes. A semantic segmentation network model is designed to classify each pixel of an image into water, land or sky. The segmentation result is refined by the conditional random field (CRF) method. It is further improved accordingly by referring to the superpixel map. A weight map is generated based on the prediction confidence. The network trains itself with the refined pseudo label and the weight map. A set of experiments were designed to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits excellent performance with few-shot learning and is quite adaptable to a new environment, very efficient for limited manual labeled data utilization.},
